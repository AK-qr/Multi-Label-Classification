# Multi-label classification project

---

### Introduction :
In a multi-label classification problem, each sample can belong to multiple classes or labels. This is different from a traditional single-label classification problem, where each sample can only belong to one class or label. Common approaches to solving multi-label classification problems include binary relevance, classifier chains, and label powerset. These methods can be used in conjunction with traditional machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

### EDA :
EDA is typically the first step in the data analysis process and is used to gain insight into the data and to identify potential issues or outliers.
